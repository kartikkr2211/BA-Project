The "Car Accident Dashboard" is a data visualization project developed using Tableau, aimed at analyzing and visualizing road accident data across four consecutive years: 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide an intuitive overview of the frequency, severity, and potential causes of road accidents over time, allowing viewers to observe trends and gain insights into factors that may contribute to road safety improvements.
By leveraging Tableau's robust data visualization capabilities, the dashboard effectively translates complex data into an easily understandable format. This project offers a clear perspective on how accident statistics fluctuate over the years, highlighting critical metrics such as accident frequency, accident-prone locations, contributing factors, and the demographic breakdown of individuals involved.
